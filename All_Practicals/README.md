# Machine Learning Practicals – MSC Computer Science

This repository contains the complete set of machine learning practicals as part of the MSc Computer Science curriculum.  
Each practical focuses on implementing core ML concepts including preprocessing, regression, classification, clustering, model evaluation, and neural networks.

The goal of this repository is to provide clean, well-documented implementations along with visualisations and insights for each task.
